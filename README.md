# Recursive Balanced Binary Tree Package

Implemented a recursive balanced binary tree package with and without parallelization using Java Collection Framework. It also includes a comparasion of parallelized and non-parallelized implementation. Parallelization brought an improvement in performace of about 15-25% on an average. The improvement was much significant with trees with higher number of nodes.
